			<h3> Altough these characters are the root of the game and make big difference, they are not controlled by
				the player.
			</h3>
		</li>

		<li>
			<h3 class="question">Draw your imagination of this game. What does this game look like?</h3>
			<h3 class="ans">Ans. The game has a striker, and 13 coins to shoot, and pockets that will eat the coins.
				<br>
				The game board lines will be finely placed at exact patterned posiitions. The game would have proper
				placement of objects.
				<br> I have a basic project layout ready. The game looks like this initially: <br>
				<a href="images/Game Thumbnail - 1.jpg" target="_blank">
					<img src="images/Game Thumbnail - 1.jpg" alt="Home" width="230" draggable="false" border="3">
				</a>
				<a href="images/Game Thumbnail - 2.jpg" target="_blank">
					<img src="images/Game Thumbnail - 2.jpg" alt="Information Screen" width="230" draggable="false"
						border="3">
				</a>
				<a href="images/Game Thumbnail - 3.jpg" target="_blank">
					<img src="images/Game Thumbnail - 3.jpg" alt="Basic Play Screen" width="230" draggable="false"
						border="3">
				</a>
				<a href="images/Game Thumbnail - 4.jpg" target="_blank">
					<img src="images/Game Thumbnail - 4.jpg" alt="Shot with Striker Screen" width="230"
						draggable="false" border="3">
				</a>
				<a href="images/Game Thumbnail - 5.jpg" target="_blank">
					<img src="images/Game Thumbnail - 5.jpg" alt="Game Menu" height="287" draggable="false" border="3">
				</a>
				<br>
				Surely there will be updates in the looks of the game. It is not predictable with accuracy at the
				beginning. The updates of the game might make the images look different from the game. The images are
				of the Classical Carrom Game that was previously available. It is no longer available. Play the all new
				Carrom game now! It is even better.

		</li>

		<li>
			<h3 class="question">How do you plan to make your game engaging? </h3>
			<h3 class="ans">Ans. To make the game more engaging, there are lots of ideas I have, a few of them will be
				added in the game.
				<ol>
					<li>
						Online 4:4 carrom game
					</li>
					<li>
						Professional Black and White Game
					</li>
					<li>
						Tournaments with many games and mutiple players
					</li>
					<li>
						Multi-player integration in game
						<ul class="double-list">
							<li>
								Four player, or
							</li>
							<li>
								Two player
							</li>
						</ul>
					<li>
						Positive Feedbacks to player so that he/she feels good.
					</li>
					<li>
						Rankings all over the world.
					</li>
					<li>
						High score amongst all players
					</li>
					<li>
						Realtime Player chat so that there is conversation between the players. Types:
						<ul class="double-list">
							<li>
								Text chat
							</li>
							<li>
								Emoji chat
							</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>
						Friend invitations
					</li>
					<li>
						Friend message chat
					</li>
					<li>
						Account integration in game. Reasons:
						<ul class="double-list">
							<li>
								Players can save their playing history
							</li>
							<li>
								They have a safe of their previous matches
							</li>
							<li>
								Their previous chat is intact and friend invitation gets possbile. Reasons:
								<ul id="triple-list">
									<li>
										User does not have to invite his/her friend(s) to the game every time they wanna
										play.
									</li>
									<li>
										Without account, the information of friends and their chat is not visible
									</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li>
								Gives professionalism to the game
							</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>
						Allowing Guest user. Reasons:
						<ul class="double-list">
							<li>
								Players who don't want to play much and are just for light play don't have to create an
								account
							</li>
							<li>
								Some people who want to play more than just rare, and not want to share their
								information with others, can enter guest mode so that their information is not saved.
							</li>
							<li>
								People who don't want to be much social for friend and invitations, can use guest mode.
							</li>
							<li>
								There can be personal reasons for people to have guest mode. But there is no offense to
								anyone to use guest mode or logged in mode.
							</li>
